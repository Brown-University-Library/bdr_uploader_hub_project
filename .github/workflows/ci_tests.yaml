# =============================================================================
# CI WORKFLOW DOCUMENTATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# name: ci-tests-yaml
#   - The display name of this workflow in the GitHub Actions UI.
#   - Note: If you change this, the GitHub Actions UI will continue to display,
#     as long as the old name is used in any previous runs. You can ddelete
#     those runs manually, and then the old name will no longer be visible.
#
# on:
#   push: [ main ]
#     - Run the workflow on any push to the main branch.
#   pull_request: [ main ]
#     - Run the workflow for PRs targeting main. GitHub automatically creates
#       a temporary merge commit for PR runs, so we do NOT perform our manual
#       merge simulation in this case.
#   workflow_dispatch:
#     - Allows manual runs from any branch. Includes an input, run_merge_sim,
#       to control whether we simulate merging main before tests (default: true).
#     - Helpful for ad-hoc CI runs without opening a PR.
#
# concurrency:
#   group: ci-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
#   cancel-in-progress: true
#     - Ensures only one run per workflow/ref combination; newer runs cancel
#       any previous in-progress run to save CI resources.
#
# jobs.build:
#   name: continuous_integration
#   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     - Single job that performs checkout, environment setup, dependency
#       installation, and test execution on Ubuntu.
#
# steps:
#   - actions/checkout@v4 (fetch-depth: 0)
#       Fetches the full git history so we can merge main when simulating PRs.
#
#   - astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
#       Installs uv (version 0.8.0) and enables caching to speed up installs.
#
#   - actions/setup-python@v5
#       Selects the Python version declared in pyproject.toml via
#       python-version-file, ensuring local and CI Python versions match.
#
#   - Configure git identity (for merge)
#       Only on non-PR runs and when run_merge_sim is not 'false'. Sets a bot
#       identity required by git for creating merge commits.
#
#   - Simulate PR merge with main (non-PR runs)
#       When manually triggered (or other non-PR events), fetches and merges
#       origin/main into the current branch to test the code as it would look
#       after merging. Helps catch integration issues early.
#
#   - Install dependencies
#       Uses 'uv sync --locked' to create a reproducible environment strictly
#       from the lockfile.
#
#   - Run tests
#       Exports DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings_run_tests and runs the
#       Django test suite with 'uv run ./manage.py test'. This mirrors the
#       project's recommended local test command.
